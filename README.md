#Welcome to my GitHub pages reposotory

This is a README for my assignments for my csc 372 class.

This webpage will host my work in *WebDev* class.

I will use this opportunity to learn how to create a website and later change it to tell a little story about my life and how i got into programming. eventually this will be my portfolio webpage.
